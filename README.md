# CAPSTONE-1-HOTEL-BOOKING-ANALYSIS

Project Name - Hotel Booking Analysis

Project Summary:

The Hotel Booking EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project is aimed at analyzing a dataset of hotel bookings to gain insights and understanding of the booking patterns, preferences, and behavior of customers. The dataset contains information on over 100,000 hotel bookings from two hotels, one located in a resort city and the other in a city center.

The EDA process begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, which involves handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues. Exploratory data analysis techniques such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and hypothesis testing are then used to analyze the data and draw insights.

Problem Statement:

The problem statement for the Hotel Booking EDA project is to gain insights into the booking patterns, preferences, and behavior of customers using a dataset of over 100,000 hotel bookings from two hotels. The goal is to understand the factors that influence hotel bookings, such as seasonality, customer segments, room types, meal plans, booking lead time, and cancellations. By analyzing these factors, the project aims to provide actionable insights to hotel management and marketing teams to improve pricing, promotions, customer segmentation, and other strategies that can enhance customer satisfaction and increase revenue.
